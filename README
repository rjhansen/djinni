The goal of Djinni is to provide a library for constrained
combinatorial optimization which is:

    * Understandable.  The entire workings of Djinni should be
      comprehensible to a Management Sciences undergraduate
      who has a little talent for programming.

    * Comprehensive.  Tabu search, annealing, genetic algorithms,
      hybrid systems, bounded approximation algorithms and more
      should all be provided.

    * Efficient.  Djinni's core should strive for efficiency and
      speed.  However, there will be no trade-off with the
      understandability of the code.  Any compromise between code
      efficiency and code clarity is based on a false dichotomy:
      we will have clarity with efficiency or we will have neither
      at all.

At present we are meeting all of our goals save for the second.

Full API documentation can be generated by going into the src/
subdirectory and running Doxygen.  Please note that the documentation
will not be automatically built; this removes a dependency on Doxygen
we would otherwise have.

Thank you for downloading Djinni, and we hope that it's helpful to
you in your searches!
